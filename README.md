# Weather-App

This JavaScript Weather app will help you to know about the weather of any location.

If you input the name of any city in the input box here, in the box below you can find out 
all its information like temperature, wind speed and sky conditions.

I took the help of API Link to create this project. With this link all the information will be collected from other
places with the help of "fetch" method. First we created its basic structure using HTML and CSS. Then I implemented it using JavaScript.
